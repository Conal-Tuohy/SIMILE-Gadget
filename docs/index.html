<h1>Gadget</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>Gadget is an XML inspector. <small>[sound of inspector
gadget theme playing in the back]</small></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="images/screenshot.png" alt="Gadget Screenshot"/></p>
<h2>What can I do with this?</h2>
<p>When you want to have a condensed representation of (normally, a lot!) of well-formed <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> data.</p>
<p>This is normally useful in situations like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>data understanding and exploration</li>
  <li>data migration/transformation</li>
  <li>data cleanup</li>
  <li>data complexity evaluation</li>
  <li>schema adherence understanding</li>
  <li>schema emergence</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why was it built?</h2>
<p>I was given the task of transforming a few hundred Mb of
XML into RDF and I found out (the hard way!) that with that amount of
data things start to break down: you need radically different
approaches since you can't simply open your 100Mb XML document in your
browser to take a look at it.</p>
<p>Before writing Gadget I used a collection of 12-stages-long
grep+sed+sort+uniq pipelines to understand what I had in that big XML pile, 
but that started to become a little cumbersome so I wrote this.</p>
<h2>How much data can it handle?</h2>
<p>Gadget is built with scalability in mind and, in theory, there is no limit 
to the amount of data it can handle. In practice, once the indexer starts hitting the disk
things slow down considerably. If you can give your JVM as much as RAM as your
XML data, you should be fine and the indexer should be very fast (1Mb/sec). 
If not, the indexer will start hitting the disk and it can even become a few orders of magnitude
slower (10Kb/sec).</p>
<p>The indexer is the heavy-lifter; once that is done, the web application
runs only off the indices and therefore is very fast and can scale to a lot of concurrent
access. It is also completely stateless so it can be heavily parallelized horizontally in clusters
would such a need emerge.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Gadget is composed of two parts, a command line application to index the data and 
a web application to browse/search the results of the indexing process. Both are written 
in Java and they require:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java 1.4</a> or later
compatible virtual machine for your operating system.</li>
  <li><a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 2.0</a> or above</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ok, ok, I'm interested, now what?</h2>
<p>Follow me to the <a href="userguide.html">user guide</a> where we'll
see what we can do with this.</p>
<h2>Where do I download it?</h2>
<p>You can obtain Gadget in two different ways:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>download a <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/dist/gadget/">prepackaged
distribution</a>
  </li>
  <li>download the files directly from the code repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>In case you want to download the files from the repository (for
example, if you want to have the latest and greatest development
snapshot), you need to have a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
client installed. At this point, just type</p>
<pre>svn co http://simile.mit.edu/repository/gadget/trunk/ gadget</pre>
<p>at the command line and the latest gadget distribution will appear
in the "gadget" directory.
</p>
